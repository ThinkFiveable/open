## Goals

The Fiveable Open Source Initiative aims to create more community and opportunities for students interested in
all things STEM and coding related. No prior experience is necessary. On this website, students will have the
opportunity to submit their open-source projects to be featured on the website. This website also serves as a
resource for students to discover open source projects to contribute to.

## What is open source?

Open source projects are projects with public source code that anyone can modify, share, and make enhancements
to. Contributors may add new features to the project or fix bugs that cause usability issues. Every open
source project has a license that determines the way people can use, distribute, or modify the software.

## How can I get involved?

Join the Fiveable Discord server at [discord.gg/thinkfiveable](https://discord.gg/thinkfiveable) and check out
the #open-source channel which serves as the main discussion forum for this initiative. The GitHub repository
