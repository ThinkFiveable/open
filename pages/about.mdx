## Goals

The Fiveable Open Source Initiative aims to create more community and opportunities for students interested in
all things STEM and coding related. No prior experience is necessary. Students have the opportunity to submit
their open-source projects through making a pull request on this
[repository](https://github.com/ThinkFiveable/open) to be featured on the website. This website also serves as
a resource for students to discover open source projects to contribute to.

## What is open source?

Open source projects are projects with public source code that anyone can modify, share, and make enhancements
to. Contributors may add new features to the project or fix bugs that cause usability issues. Every open
source project has a license that determines the way people can use, distribute, or modify the software.

## How can I get involved?

Join the Fiveable Discord server at [discord.gg/thinkfiveable](https://discord.gg/thinkfiveable) and check out
the #open-source channel which serves as the main discussion forum for this initiative. The GitHub repository
can be found [here](https://github.com/ThinkFiveable/open). We are currently accepting submissions for open
source projects through pull requests.

## How do I submit my project?

Head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thinkfiveable/open) and navigate to the file
`PROJECTS.JSON` located in the directory `data`. Add the information for your project in the following format:

```json
     {
        "repoName": "Name of your repo here",
        "repoOwner": "GitHub username here",
        "projectType": "Type of project",
        "projectDescription": "Describe your project here."
    },
```

Then, make a pull request, and ask someone to review it! If you need any help, check out our
[Git tutorials](/docs/git) or ask in the #open-source channel on the Discord!
